# Ad Astra Recruitment Website 24-25

A recruitment website for Ad Astra, with interactive about section, marquee, and footer components as my assigned sections for development.

**Live Website:** [https://theadastra.org/join/2024/](https://theadastra.org/join/2024/)

## Overview

The Ad Astra Recruitment Website 2024 was launched during the first term of A.Y. 2024–2025. It served as the official platform for the Student Inclusion (SI) Week of DLS-CSB, inviting aspiring student-journalists to join Ad Astra, one of the official publications under the Student Publications Unit (SPU).

This project contains the front-end implementation for the Ad Astra recruitment campaign. It includes responsive layouts, interactive carousels, and social media integration.
